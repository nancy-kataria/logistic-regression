# Logistic Regression on Penguin Dataset

This project implements Logistic Regression on the Penguins dataset to classify penguin species based on their bill length and bill depth. The model is evaluated using different penalties (None and L2) and visualized using decision boundary plots.

## Features

- Uses Logistic Regression for binary classification
- Evaluates the model with one and two features:
  - Bill Length (mm)
  - Bill Depth (mm)
- Applies both 'None' and 'L2' regularization penalties
- Generates decision boundary plots using plot_decision_regions
- Classifies Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins
